# Secure-Segmented-Intra-College-Club-Portal


Student clubs across branches lacked a **centralized and secure communication system**, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, and inefficient network usage.

To solve this, we designed a **secure intra-college network** with **role-based access (Lead / Representative / Member)** and **controlled communication** between clubs and branches.

The solution uses **VLAN segmentation**, **Extended ACLs**, **WAN connectivity**, **DNS**, and **SSH-secured routers** to ensure only authorized users can access management resources while improving performance.

This project demonstrates **enterprise-style network security and access control** in an academic environment.
